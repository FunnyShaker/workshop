# PizzaPalace Website

## 1. Introduction

Local restaurants frequently struggle to maintain a strong online presence, limiting their ability to attract new customers and promote their products effectively. PizzaPalace is a local pizza restaurant chosen by our team to address this common issue. The shop currently lacks a dedicated website, forcing customers to rely on paper advertisements or third-party delivery services that charge high commissions and deter repeat customers.

Our team aims to design and develop a modern, responsive website for PizzaPalace that enables direct customer engagement, online ordering, and digital management of promotions and loyalty programs. This project will serve as both a technical exercise in full-stack web development and a business solution that increases restaurant profitability and customer satisfaction.

## 2. Overview

The PizzaPalace Website Project will deliver a full-featured online platform for a local restaurant. The site will allow users to browse the menu, customize their orders, and place delivery or pickup requests. Staff will have access to an admin dashboard for order management, menu editing, and customer feedback tracking.

### 2.1 Objective
Develop a responsive, database-driven website for PizzaPalace that provides customers with a secure online ordering experience, while enabling administrators to manage menus, promotions, and loyalty programs through an integrated dashboard—using modern, industry-standard development tools for design, testing, and version control.


## 3. Milestones

At least five major milestones have been identified for the project’s development lifecycle:

1. Technological stack finalized – front-end (React), back-end (Node.js/Express), database (MongoDB), and hosting solution defined and configured.

2. Initial front-end and back-end integration completed – website framework built, static menu and home pages designed, and tested in a development environment.

3. Online ordering system prototype developed and tested – includes basic order creation, checkout flow, and database connectivity.

4. Admin dashboard implemented and verified – staff can manage menu items, promotions, and customer feedback through a secure interface.

5. Website finalized and deployed – responsive design optimized for all devices, end-to-end testing performed, and platform made ready for user access.
