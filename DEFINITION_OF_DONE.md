- [ ] Code is properly formatted and readable with meaningful variable/function names
- [ ] No console errors or warnings in browser/server logs
- [ ] Code is optimized for performance where applicable
- [ ] Proper error handling implemented

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Code is adequately commented for complex logic
- [ ] README updated if new setup/installation steps are required
- [ ] API endpoints documented if backend changes made
- [ ] Database schema changes documented

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Feature tested manually in development environment
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verified for frontend features
- [ ] API endpoints tested using Postman (for backend features)
- [ ] Error scenarios tested and handled appropriately

### Version Control Standards
- [ ] Code committed with clear, descriptive commit messages
- [ ] Pull request created and approved by at least one team member

- [ ] Data migration scripts created if needed
- [ ] Indexing considered for performance
- [ ] Data validation rules applied at database level
- [ ] Backup/recovery considerations documented

## User Story Completion
For a user story to be considered "Done":

- [ ] Acceptance criteria fully satisfied
- [ ] User can complete the described task successfully
- [ ] Feature works as described in the user story
- [ ] Edge cases and error scenarios handled
- [ ] User experience is intuitive and smooth

## Sprint Completion
For a sprint to be considered "Done":

- [ ] All planned user stories completed according to DoD
- [ ] Sprint goals achieved
- [ ] Demo prepared for stakeholder review
- [ ] Retrospective conducted and documented
- [ ] Next sprint backlog updated based on current progress

## Release Criteria
For a release to be considered "Done":

- [ ] All features in release scope completed
- [ ] End-to-end testing completed successfully
- [ ] Performance testing shows acceptable load times
- [ ] Security review completed (authentication, data protection)
- [ ] Deployment process tested and documented
- [ ] Rollback plan established

## Quality Gates
Before marking any item as "Done":

1. **Self-Review**: Developer reviews own work against this checklist
2. **Peer Review**: At least one team member reviews and approves
3. **Testing**: Manual testing completed in development environment
4. **Integration**: Feature successfully integrated without breaking existing functionality

## Exception Handling
If any DoD criteria cannot be met due to technical constraints or time limitations:

- [ ] Exception must be documented with reasoning
- [ ] Technical debt issue created for future resolution
- [ ] Risk assessment completed and communicated to team
- [ ] Stakeholders informed of any impacted functionality
